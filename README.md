# About-me

### 	As a data analyst, I apply my engineering background and analytical skills to support the growth and development of InnoBiz Community and Chulalongkorn University Student Government. I create evaluation forms, criteria, indicators, and processes for collecting and analyzing data from various projects, and provide summaries and recommendations based on the results. I also work with the R&D department and other departments to ensure alignment and collaboration.
### 	I have a passion for data analytics and project management. I am seeking to utilize my engineering and data analysis expertise in a business-oriented role within technology companies.
