# About-me

## As a business development and a data analyst, I apply my engineering background and analytical skills to support the growth and development of InnoBiz Community and Chulalongkorn University Student Government. I create evaluation forms, criteria, indicators, and processes for collecting and analyzing data from various projects, and provide summaries and recommendations based on the results. I also work with the R&D department and other departments to ensure alignment and collaboration.

## I expect to graduate from Chulalongkorn University in 2025 with a bachelor's degree in nuclear engineering, and I have a passion for data analytics and project management. I have completed multiple online courses and certifications in Google data analytics, project management, business intelligence, and SQL fundamentals. I am seeking to utilize my engineering and data analysis expertise in a business-oriented role within technology companies.
